# Senior Project
Note: Senior project. Structured around MVP.

A Fitness Android Application that is aimed to help bring the community of runners in Boston together. 

# What I learned
* Implementing Google Maps API. 
* Given resources online, I managed to figure out how to display the users current location on the map.
* MaterialDesign for design.

# Future Planning
* Create a Chat Room where users can communicate with local friends.
* Track users displacement and display it on map when the workout is finished.
